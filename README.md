Book list in JavaScript, HTML/CSS and Bootstrap.

Based on Brad Traversy's book list but with a few changes (by me).

My changes:

- visual;
- add some extra logic stuff {

      v1:
      - delete by title,
      - responsive desktop,
      - required fields

      v2:
      - delete all books from list

      v3:
      - filter by title, author and publisher

  }

- to do { - owned, to buy tag - ,etc
  }
