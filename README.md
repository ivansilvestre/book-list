Book list in JavaScript, HTML/CSS and Bootstrap.
( based on Brad Traversy's book list app but with a few changes by me )

App here:
https://i-book-list.netlify.app

My changes:

- visual;
- add some extra logic stuff {

      v1:
      - delete by title,
      - responsive desktop,
      - required fields

      v2:
      - delete all books from list

      v3:
      - filter by title, author and publisher

  }

- TODO: owned tag, to buy tag,etc
